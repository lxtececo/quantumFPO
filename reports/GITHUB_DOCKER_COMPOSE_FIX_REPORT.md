# GitHub Actions Docker Compose Fix Report

## Problem Identified

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
yaml: line 52: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `integration-tests` job where the workflow attempted to modify the main `docker-compose.yml` file using `sed` commands to replace build configurations with pre-built image references. These modifications were:

1. **Destructive**: Used global replacement (`g` flag) causing multiple unintended substitutions
2. **Incomplete**: Left orphaned YAML keys like `context:` and `dockerfile:` 
3. **Invalid YAML**: Created malformed YAML structure leading to parsing errors

### Problematic Code
```bash
sed -i "s|build:|image: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}-frontend:${{ github.sha }}|g" docker-compose.yml
sed -i "s|context: ./frontend||g" docker-compose.yml
sed -i "s|dockerfile: Dockerfile||g" docker-compose.yml
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Created Dedicated CI Compose File
- **File**: `docker-compose.ci.yml`
- **Purpose**: Clean configuration using pre-built images via environment variables
- **Benefits**: 
  - No runtime YAML modification required
  - Cleaner separation between local dev and CI environments
  - Maintainable and version-controlled

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `sed` command approach with environment variable substitution
- Uses `docker-compose.ci.yml` for integration testing
- Added image pushing for non-main branches to support PR testing
- Updated all compose commands to use the CI-specific file

### 3. Enhanced Image Availability Strategy
**Before:** Images only pushed for main branch (causing PR failures)
**After:** 
- Main branch: Push with proper tags for production
- Other branches/PRs: Push with SHA tags for integration testing

## Key Improvements

### Reliability
✅ **No YAML manipulation**: Eliminates parsing errors
✅ **Predictable behavior**: Same compose file used across all CI runs
✅ **Proper error handling**: Clear separation of concerns

### Maintainability  
✅ **Version controlled**: CI compose configuration is tracked
✅ **Environment specific**: Local dev vs CI configurations separated
✅ **Self-documenting**: Clear comments and structure

### Functionality
✅ **PR support**: Images available for pull request testing
✅ **Branch testing**: All branches can run integration tests
✅ **Clean environments**: Proper service dependencies and health checks

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/containerized-ci-cd.yml`**
   - Removed destructive `sed` commands
   - Added CI-specific compose file usage
   - Enhanced image pushing strategy

2. **`docker-compose.ci.yml`** (New)
   - Clean CI/CD compose configuration
   - Environment variable driven image selection
   - Proper health checks and dependencies

## Testing Status

✅ **Local Validation**: `docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml config` passes
✅ **YAML Syntax**: No parsing errors
✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly substituted
✅ **Service Dependencies**: Correct startup order maintained

## Expected Results

The GitHub Actions workflow should now:
1. Build and push images successfully for all branches
2. Use clean CI compose configuration without YAML errors
3. Run integration tests against properly orchestrated services
4. Support both main branch and pull request workflows

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix:
1. Commit and push changes
2. Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution
3. Confirm "Start services with Docker compose" step passes
4. Validate all three services start and become healthy
5. Check integration tests run successfully

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Test the workflow with a new commit/PR
2. **Short-term**: Monitor for any additional CI/CD issues
3. **Long-term**: Consider containerizing the entire CI environment for better consistency
